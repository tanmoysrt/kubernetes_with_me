1. Root element -> $ if there is no root element
2. We can find json with . and in case of list by index [0] or [1]
3. if there is a list and want to find all numbers > 40
    $[?(@>40)]
    > , < , != , == operator available
4. If we want to get element of more than 1 index, use [start_index, end_index] and to get for a range [start_index:end_index]
5. Wildcard -> * [To escape a level, useful to explore element of dictionaries in list]
6. Wilcard can be used in indexing as well like $[*]
7. while using [1], [2] index, we can also use [-1:0] or [-1:] to get last element
